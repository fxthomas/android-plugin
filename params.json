In case\r\nyou're not not familiar with sbt make sure to check out its excellent\r\n[Getting Started Guide][sbt-getting-started] first.\r\n\r\n## Hacking on the plugin\r\n\r\nIf you need make modifications to the plugin itself, you can compile\r\nand install it locally (you need at least sbt 0.11.x to build it):\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/jberkel/android-plugin.git\r\n    $ cd android-plugin\r\n    $ sbt publish-local\r\n\r\n## Migrating from 0.7.x\r\n\r\nFor those who are familiar with the 0.7.x plugin, there is a [migration guide][]\r\nfor a quick reference. The 0.7.x version is no longer maintained - but it is\r\nstill available in the [0.7.x][] branch.\r\n\r\n## Mailing list\r\n\r\nThere's no official mailing list for the project but most contributors hang\r\nout in [scala-on-android][] or [simple-build-tool][].\r\n\r\nYou can also check out a list of\r\n[projects using sbt-android-plugin][] to see some real-world examples.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nThis code is based on work by Walter Chang\r\n([saisiyat](http://github.com/weihsiu/saisiyat/)), turned into a plugin by\r\n[Mark Harrah](http://github.com/harrah), and maintained by\r\n[Jan Berkel](https://github.com/jberkel).\r\n\r\nA lot of people have contributed to the plugin; see [contributors][] for a full\r\nlist.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jberkel/android-plugin.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jberkel/android-plugin)\r\n\r\n[sbt]: https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki\r\n[scala-on-android]: http://groups.google.com/group/scala-on-android\r\n[simple-build-tool]: http://groups.google.com/group/simple-build-tool\r\n[0.7.x]: https://github.com/jberkel/android-plugin/tree/0.7.x\r\n[migration guide]: https://github.com/jberkel/android-plugin/wiki/migration_guide\r\n[contributors]: https://github.com/jberkel/android-plugin/wiki/Contributors\r\n[homebrew]: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew\r\n[projects using sbt-android-plugin]: https://github.com/jberkel/android-plugin/wiki/Projects-using-sbt-android-plugin\r\n[Getting started]: https://github.com/jberkel/android-plugin/wiki/getting-started\r\n[giter8]: https://github.com/n8han/giter8\r\n[sbt-getting-started]: http://scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Welcome\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
